        <div class="translucent-paragraph">
            <p>Hi I'm Aman Dsouza, a Student pusuing Computer Engineering at Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering. I’m someone who loves blending creativity with logic. Engineering fascinates me because it lets me explore how things work and find innovative solutions to problems. I also have a passion for drawing, which allows me to express myself and bring my ideas to life in a unique way. Reading is another one of my favorite pastimes, as it broadens my knowledge, offers new perspectives, and feeds my curiosity. Whether I’m building something, sketching, or diving into a good book, I’m always looking for ways to learn, create, and explore the world around me.</p>
